(BEGIN)

1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:11,650
I might never be your knight in shining armour

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,447
I might never be the one you take home to mother

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,285
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:23,377
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

5
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:26,960
When I first saw you

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From across the room

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could tell that you were curious,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yeah

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girl, I hope you’re sure

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you're looking for

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like having secret little rendezvous

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, I'm perfect

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, I'm perfect for you

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, you're perfect

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, you're perfect

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So let's start right now

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might never be the hands you put your heart in

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that don’t mean that we can’t live here in the moment

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I first saw you

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From across the room

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could tell that you were curious,

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yeah

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girl, I hope you’re sure

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you're looking for

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like having secret little rendezvous

36

If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, I'm perfect

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, I'm perfect for you

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, you're perfect

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, you're perfect

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So let's start right now

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out,

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yeah

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you're looking for someone to write your break-up songs about

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, I'm perfect

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, we're perfect

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like having secret little rendezvous

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, I'm perfect

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, I'm perfect for you

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then baby, you're perfect

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Baby, you're perfect

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So let's start right now

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
